This project was developed to learn how to publish npm package

First create project
Then test your new app with "npm link" command
Finally you can publish with "npm publish" command

"npm publish --access=public" / if you use this command you can publish the package as publicly
if you want to use name space for your package. You must change name key's value in package.js with "@<namespace>/<your_package_name>"  

Note: If you get an authorization related error, you must login to npm with the "npm login" command.
